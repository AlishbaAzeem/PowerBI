"During my internship at Dun & Bradstreet, I extensively utilized Microsoft Excel to perform data cleaning, sorting, filtering, and validation tasks on large commercial datasets. I applied functions such as VLOOKUP, IF statements, and conditional formatting to identify inconsistencies and ensure data accuracy across thousands of records. Additionally, I prepared organized and visually clear reports summarizing data quality findings, which were shared with the quality control team for review. My proficiency in Excel allowed me to streamline repetitive tasks, reducing manual effort and increasing overall data processing efficiency. Furthermore, I used Microsoft Word to document processes and Microsoft PowerPoint to create concise presentations that communicated key insights and project updates to supervisors and team members."
